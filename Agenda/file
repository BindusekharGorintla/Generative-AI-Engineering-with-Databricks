Generative AI Solution Development
This course is designed to introduce participants to contextual generative AI solutions using the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method. Firstly, participants will be introduced to the RAG architecture and the significance of contextual information using Mosaic AI Playground. Next, the course will demonstrate how to prepare data for generative AI solutions and connect this process with building an RAG architecture. Finally, participants will explore concepts related to context embedding, vectors, vector databases, and the utilization of the Mosaic AI Vector Search product.

Prerequisites
The content was developed for participants with these skills/knowledge/abilities:

Familiarity with natural language processing concepts
Familiarity with prompt engineering/prompt engineering best practices
Familiarity with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform
