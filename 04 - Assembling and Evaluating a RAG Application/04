Assembling and Registering a RAG Application
In the previous demo, we created a Vector Search Index. To build a complete RAG application, it is time to connect all the components that you have learned so far and evaluate the performance of the RAG.

After evaluating the performance of the RAG pipeline, we will create and deploy a new Model Serving Endpoint to perform RAG.

Learning Objectives:

By the end of this demo, you will be able to:

Describe embeddings, vector databases, and search/retrieval as key components of implementing performant RAG applications.
Assemble a RAG pipeline by combining various components.
Build a RAG evaluation pipeline with MLflow evaluation functions.
Register a RAG pipeline to the Model Registry.
